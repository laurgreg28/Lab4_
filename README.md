*Did not get to finish

I am implementing the Factory Method Pattern and the Strategy Pattern.

I will implement the Factory Method Pattern in the AddEventModal class when creating Event object, Deadline or Meeting. 
I will create an EventFactory class with a createEvent(String type) method that returns a Deadline or Meeting based on the type. 

I will implement the Strategy Pattern in the EventListPanel and EventPanel.
I will use for when I am sorting events in EventListPanel for sortDropDown. I will create comparator classes for the names and dates.
